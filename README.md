# Description
This application can be used to manage your wine cellar. 

# In development
This application is still in development and should not be considered to be complete

## Planned
* More generic classes to facilitate adding other views more easily
* Name Consistency (e.g. plural vs singular)
* Remove unnecessary usings
* Lower API calls
* Use automapper
* Replace eventAggregator singleton with DI, using autofac
* Expand API to provide statistics on the cellar (total value, bottles, ...)
* Add more to this readme.md
